to solve this you must first type in random login and password
and then intercept this POST request or look it up in the history

then forward this request to burp intruder via right click

in burp intruder select this random password
which is posed in html text username=random_username
then in payload configuration paste payloads you copied from text list 
given in lab

and now you enumarete the username which means you check if any of
given usernames exist
check for response length, one will vary because it will say
"incorrect password" instead of "invalid user" or sth like that
now u got the username

then in intruder http request you type in this username and now select
the password to add a payload
add copied passwords in list format to payload
check for status code, one will vary and instead of http 200 will be 302
